> Introduction:\
> Welcome to another update on my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project, where I've been diving deep into the world of Postgres extension development. Over the past two weeks (Day 14 to Day 28), I've made significant progress, overcoming challenges, refining tutorial content, and organizing my repository. In this blog post, I will share the highlights of my journey, from restructuring tutorials to mastering the Makefile and everything in between.

**Restructuring Tutorials and Refining Content:**\
To ensure comprehensive coverage of essential topics in Postgres extension development, I started by restructuring my tutorial list. I carefully refined the content, creating a first draft that would serve as a valuable resource for developers. To identify any gaps, I also explored third-party resources, incorporating their insights to refine my content further.

**Exploring Extension Creation Methods:**\
One of the major challenges I encountered was dealing with Makefile errors. However, by diligently studying the Makefile's role and best practices for its configuration, I was able to overcome these issues. I explored different extension creation methods and documented my learnings, making it easier for future developers to navigate through potential hurdles.

**Milestones and Deliverables:**\
During this phase, I achieved important milestones by completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) tutorial and the associated deliverables list. By consulting the official documentation and limiting my exploration of redundant resources, I successfully resolved the Makefile issues. This allowed me to stay focused on creating original tutorial content and providing a streamlined development experience.

**Repository Organization:**\
To enhance the accessibility and usability of my GitHub repository, I dedicated time to reorganize the folders. I created separate sections for code, quick start content, and archival of old content. This systematic approach ensures that developers can easily find what they need and allows for efficient collaboration.

**Exploring Prerequisites:**\
Understanding the prerequisites for extension creation was crucial. I delved into the architecture of extensions, familiarized myself with the supported languages, and grasped the underlying concepts. This groundwork set a solid foundation for the rest of my journey.

**Directory Hierarchy:**\
Recognizing the importance of a well-structured directory hierarchy, I proposed basic, intermediate, and advanced structures based on real-world extension examples. By studying these examples, I refined my own hierarchy to ensure clarity and maintainability.

**Taking a Break:**\
In the midst of this intense project, I recognized the need to recharge. Taking a short break allowed me to rejuvenate and return with fresh perspectives and renewed energy, enabling me to tackle challenges more effectively.

**Demystifying Essential Extension Files:**\
To deepen my understanding, I focused on demystifying crucial extension files such as SQL scripts, control files, Makefiles, code files, regression tests, and documentation. This comprehensive exploration equipped me with the necessary knowledge to create robust and well-documented extensions.

**Mastering the Makefile:**\
A key aspect of my journey was mastering the Makefile, which involved understanding targets/rules, commands, phony targets, dependencies, and integrating regression tests. By gaining proficiency in the Makefile, I streamlined my development workflow and improved the overall efficiency of my project.

> Conclusion:\
> Over the past two weeks of my GSoC project, I've made significant progress in Postgres extension development. By restructuring tutorials, refining content, and exploring third-party resources, I've created a valuable resource for developers. Overcoming challenges, such as Makefile errors, and achieving milestones, including the completion of the MVP tutorial, have further solidified my knowledge. Organizing my repository, understanding prerequisites, refining the directory hierarchy, and demystifying essential extension files have all contributed to a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Mastering the Makefile has been a significant achievement, streamlining my development workflow
